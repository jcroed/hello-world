# hello-world
Test project. 
I have recently retired after several decades of working with computers and software in a variety of ways.  While not primarily a programmer, I have written quite a bit if code to accomplish the tasks I was faced with in my work with statistics and databases. Now I am dabbling in a variety of areas such as home automation for my own entertainment.
